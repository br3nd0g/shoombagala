# Shoombagala - Work in progress

A discord bot which users can use to 'roll' a monster from the game "My Singing Monsters". Named after the tune heard on the loading screen of My Singing Monsters.

The bot uses the discord API and webscraping to create the user experience.

## Functionality

Rolls a random monster and rarity from the game, gets the image of said monster and sends an embed to discord where the user can react to the message to 'claim' the monster in that server.

Along with this, users are able to see all their claimed monsters in the server in another command
